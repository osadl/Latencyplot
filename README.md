* [Data format](#data-format)
* [Python scripts](#python-scripts)
* [Examples](#examples)

## Purpose
The purpose of the this software package is to create a basis for sharing data of Linux PREEMPT_RT real-time systems and provide a program to generate latency plots from such data.

## Command line options
```bash
$ plot-rtdataset.py --help
usage: plot-rtdataset.py [-h] [-a JSON2] [-f] [-r {2,4,8}] [-v] [JSON] [PLOT]
 
positional arguments:
  JSON                  file name of a JSON RT data set to process, default "rt.json"
  PLOT                  file name of the latency plot to create, default to screen
 
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a JSON2, --addinput JSON2
                        file name of a additional JSON RT data set to be merged into first one
  -f, --formats         generate list of supported output formats
  -r {2,4,8}, --xred {2,4,8}
                        reduce x scale by 2, 4, or 8
  -v, --verbose         show what the program is doing
```

## Supported graphics formats
A list of supported graphics formats can be generated by using the '-f' command line option:
```bash
$ plot-rtdataset.py -f
Supported formats (must be provided as output file name suffix):
eps : Encapsulated Postscript
jpg : Joint Photographic Experts Group
jpeg : Joint Photographic Experts Group
pdf : Portable Document Format
pgf : PGF code for LaTeX
png : Portable Network Graphics
ps : Postscript
raw : Raw RGBA bitmap
rgba : Raw RGBA bitmap
svg : Scalable Vector Graphics
svgz : Scalable Vector Graphics
tif : Tagged Image File Format
tiff : Tagged Image File Format
Note that an animated SVG file is created when an '.svg' suffixed output file name is specified.
```

## Data format
```json
{
    "format": {
        "name": "RT Dataset",
        "version": "1.0"
    },
    "timestamps": {
        "origin": <ISO creation date of data>,
        "dataset": <ISO creation date of this file>
    },
    "system": {
        "hostname": <Name of the host undergoing the latency test>
    },
    "processor": {
        "family": <Processor family>,
        "vendor": <Processor vendor>,
        "type": <Processor type>,
        "clock": <Processor clock frequency in MHz>
    },
    "kernel": {
        "version": <Kernel version>,
        "patches": [
            <Array of lines of patch names>
        ],
        "config": [
            <Array of subsequent non-emtpy non-comment lines of the kernel configuration>
        ],
        "cmdline": <Kernel command line>
    },
    "condition": {
        "load": <System load conditions: "idle", "moderate", "heaavy" or "brute-force">,
        "cycles": <Total number of cyclictest cycles>,
        "interval": <Cyclictest interval in Âµs>,
        "cyclictest": <Cyclictest command line>
    },
    "latency": {
        "granularity": <Width of class of latency data>,
        "maxima": [
            <Array of maximum latency per core>
        ],
        "cores": [
            [
                <Two-dimensional array of number of samples per latency classes per core>
            ]
        ]
    }
}
```

## Python scripts
Two scripts are provided, one to generate a JSON data file and one to generate a latency plot from the data file. While the [first script mk-rtdataset.py](https://github.com/osadl/Latencyplot/blob/main/src/mk-rtdataset.py) is very specific and based on the particular measurement conditions of a typical OSADL QA Farm system, the [second script plot-rtdataset.py](https://github.com/osadl/Latencyplot/blob/main/src/plot-rtdataset.py) can be of general use.

## Examples
The below latency plot was generated from the [example JSON data](https://github.com/osadl/Latencyplot/blob/main/examples/r0s8.json) that are part of this repository. The two commands
```bash
mk-rtdataset.py r0s8.json
plot-rtdataset.py r0s8.json r0s8.svg
```

were executed. It should be noted that in this example the latency values have exceeded the histogram range, so that it is not sufficient to determine the maximum from the histogram itself. For such cases, the maximum latency values per core must rather be stored separately (as in the OSADL QA farm raw data) or the line beginning with "# Max Latencies:" must be evaluated additionally.

If this graph is loaded directly into an SVG-enabled browser, per-core histograms may individually be switched on and off [click here to try it out](https://www.osadl.org/Latencyplot/examples/r0s8.svg):
* Click on a legend element: The histogram of the related core is toggled.
* Ctrl-click on a legend element: All other histograms except the one of the clicked core are disabled.
* Shift-click on a legend element: All histograms are restored.

And here are some more examples from OSADL QA Farm systems:
